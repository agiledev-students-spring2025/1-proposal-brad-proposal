# Project Proposal

### Project title

Vardrobe - Your Virtual Wardrobe

### What and why?

This app serves as a virtual closet/wardrobe that contains all of your clothing in a virtual setting. I would like to make this as this opens up a bunch of possibilities for mix & matching clothing, finding new clothing to mix & match. 

It's a hassle to look through your closet to find what you have/what you don't have, a lot of people also use moodboards like pinterest or even photo app to keep track of what clothing items they want or already has. This will solve the issue of keeping inventory for fashion enthusiasts and assist them in finding their next piece.

### For whom?

This will be mostly for fashion enthusiasts, people who just like to keep inventory of their clothing, people who are starting to build out their closets

### How?

Users can scan their clothing into the app in order to keep an inventory of it. The app will use metadata either from online or from the scan itself to label the clothing and its metadata. Users can then sort through their "closet" of clothes on the app.  User can also organize clothing into folders and add custom labels themselves, bookmark a combination of clothing etc.. Potential capabilities for suggesting clothing combinations, and also potential to suggest new clothes or similar clothes.

### Scope

A simple inventory app where we utilize existing APIs to scan clothes for their metadata and then organizing should not be too difficult for a semester of work for 4-6 programmers. The hardest challenge is definitely the organizational capability of this app but I think it's totally doable to a basic state. It's essentially just an inventory app that can add label and store combinations of items.
